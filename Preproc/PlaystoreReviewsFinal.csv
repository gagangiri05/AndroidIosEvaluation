2222,Productivity Apps,Evernote,なぜこんなアプデをしてしまったのか、理解に苦しみます。 バグや動作の重さはしばらくしたら改善されるだろうと数年間我慢して来きましたが、アプデ前のようなサクサクした動作には一向に戻りませんし、未だにバグだらけ（今ちょうど、ノートが閉じれないバグが発生した所です）。パッと見はモダンになったかもしれないけれど、UXは遥かに劣化しました。 もう、時間の問題では無いのでしょう。今の運営の能力ではこのアプリを良くする事は出来ないのだと思います。今年のサブスクリプションが切れたら別のサービスに移行しようと思います。 追記：ノートを編集すると、文量によって数分から数十分まともにアプリが使えなくなり、そのノートも同期に時間がかかるのか開けません。また、かなり頻繁に編集のコリジョンがおきます。致命的なバグが増えるとは、どんな開発をしているのか想像もできません。早く別のアプリに移行したいです。,1,3/30/2023 11:22,4

3507,Productivity Apps,Otter Voice Notes,Great tool! I just wish there was an unlimited package for a reasonable subscription fee. Also I do wish the free account would allow at least an hour each time. The pastor of my church usually preaches 45 to 50 minutes a sermon so 30 mins cuts it short which is unfortunate. Very good other then that as it pretty much picks up his sermon from where I sit...in the front about 20 feet from pulpit.,5,2/19/2023 23:09,76

3599,Productivity Apps,Otter Voice Notes,非常非常糟糕的經驗，我在Google上沒有給過一星的評價，但是這次我要破例。 這是一個沒有誠信的公司，對於客戶的問題的態度是不予理會。 我是一個老用戶，一開始是直接在官方網站註冊並且繳費，也都是使用個人電腦錄音因為線上會議，當時是用月訂閱制有6000分鐘的時間。在漲價之後原本的6000分鐘縮減到1200分鐘，所以我必須要升級我的方案才有足夠的錄音時間，這些都沒問題，我也願意升級到年訂閱的方案。 隨著疫情趨緩，我開始實體的會議，所以開始用手機錄音比較多，我想就直接在手機上升級我的方案，因為是同樣的帳號。我在2023年1月1日升級到年訂閱，到期日期應該是2024年1月1日，看繳費證明是透過Google收費，目前我的Google訂閱也是顯示到期日期是2024年。 然而可能因為一開始使用的官網月訂閱沒有取消，所以我在2023年1月2號的時候，被官網收取了月訂閱的費用，而且我的訂閱到期時間從2024年1月1日變成2023年2月2日，被覆蓋過去了，等於我在手機上升級年訂閱的錢被吃掉了。 第一封信跟客服反應的結果是讓我一直等待，沒有進一步的回覆，這讓我超過Google退款時間，第二封信也沒回應。,1,1/13/2023 12:09,6

3756,Productivity Apps,Post-it,"It general, it's a nice app to mess with -- but the more I use it, the more I find it too clumsy to tackle my needs. For example, if you back out of a note, you should get a warning that your scribble is going to be lost...(uggh). I got lucky and somehow was able to pinch and zoom in -- but I have not been able to replicate something so simple. Clearly it's there -- somewhere, but not where would expect it to be consistently (e.g., everywhere would be nice for larger screen users like me). While you can re-size the note background, and scale the content to size -- you cannot move the block of content to make resizing the note more functional. Nor change the pen inking width (that I could find). Moving notes about -- it is very crude feeling for more serious matters. I have yet to find any 'gestures' to rotate notes, but I did find the 90-degree flip... (not like in the demo with slight rotations). I like the idea of the widget on my Fold3, but I find the integration to the main app to be just to awkward to use. It has plenty of potential -- any maybe buried or hidden functionality waiting for a spelunker. I am also sure it's great in select scenarios/use-cases. Overall, it is cute, but awkward. It stumbles as I tried to use it more... Also, some type of sync across devices would be helpful. The plumbing is already in, so provide an option to move the data to a cloud store (many to choose from) to support multiple devices. All in all, some cool stuff, light feel; but misses in a lot of places. I look forward to seeing where it goes a few iterations down the road.",3,3/20/2022 21:19,304

A good upgrade though would be having a DNF shelf that you can add books you have started but not completed, that way it doesn't count towards your total read for the year, but you can still have your comments about why you stopped reading it and a log of books your dnfd.

Your automated response was just a brush off. This is not a technical issue. It's a CBS greed issue. Are you guys getting paid every time a commercial replays on top of the monthly fee we pay you?? Let's see you answer that.,2,3/30/2023 2:07,65

You can add an extra message after the login number message so that the login number wouldn't show on the main chat session. This will put a stop on it. The extra message could be anything lol.

12777,Social Media Apps,Signal - Private Messenger,"Signals greatest strength was, in my opinion, SMS support. It allowed people to simply install Signal on their less tech savvy relatives phones as the default SMS app and they'd get secure communication for free when both parties had it.

Having basic matching preferences would go a long way to weeding out these interactions and others. Also tons of fake accounts on the app and the app is often buggy.",3,3/29/2023 17:03,82

14321,Lifestyle Apps,Fashion Nova,"Searching for items on the app is extraordinarily more difficult than it is on the website. If you click an item in your search and decide to go look at something else, you have to completely restart your search. If you want to filter your search (i.e. by color), you can't sort it(i.e. by price). I downloaded this app to make shopping easier but it's been annoying and very unhelpful. I'm uninstalling.",1,1/2/2023 12:50,72

Get your money.",2,12/30/2022 5:39,60
14324,Lifestyle Apps,Fashion Nova,This app needs a better filter when going through plus size clothing. It's frustrating trying to filter out a color and male clothing pops up in the results or as the ONLY result when i'm in FEMALE clothing. Aside from that the app randomly crashes. The last issue was fixed but now the Curve side is no longer in sections. It's either Shop All or New In and you can't filter the search either,3,12/29/2022 18:40,74
14325,Lifestyle Apps,Fashion Nova,My son and I both love this store,5,12/29/2022 3:21,8
14326,Lifestyle Apps,Fashion Nova,They have beautiful eyes catching stuff. The sizes are off most times. They don't refund your money only in gift card. Conversation is only by text. Keep tract of your refunds if you return more then one item. Other than that the prices are great and the items are of good quality and well made. Check out the sexy stuff!! Let's go shopping.,3,12/28/2022 14:15,63

First was with paying through Amazon, then to paying at all, it used to scroll through and show you the same things over and over, and now it's sending me all the way back to the home screen when I look at an item and then hit back. It's just sooo buggy, makes it hard to shop. ☹️",3,12/27/2022 4:24,80

14351,Lifestyle Apps,Fashion Nova,I can't even explain how awful their tracking system is and how unhelp their customer service is which by the way is only an automated message. I ordered items back in November and have yet to get them. I keep trying to track them but you have to fight with the popup about changing your country. Once you do it goes blank and you can't track your orders. I'd say it's nearly as bad as wish.,1,12/16/2022 22:12,76

Like not having to scroll all the way back down after you click on one product on your favorites.

It gives you just enough spins to get to one point then keep you there long enough for more cash which is the only way you advance. You all could do better especially at the higher levels. Smh it's a bit disappointing to get so far and then can't advance if you don't pay. I just spent 6B coins only to get 2 new cards. ROBBERY!!!",4,3/11/2023 11:46,87

17512,Games Apps,Township,I am playing this game for last 3 years. First the game is very slow. The developer want you to play for your whole life. Very unjustice and stupid things that you sell something its in coins and if you want to buy same thing its in dollars. Then he put the same pathetic season game always and it have always very short moves that some tasks are even impossible. I think developer should faster the game and open some new options and give player more options and free him to buy what he want.,1,3/31/2023 5:52,95

17969,Games Apps,Pokeman Go ,"Level 45, played since the beginning. The grind was real. Especially living in a rural area. We made the game better and the community grew.

17972,Games Apps,Pokeman Go ,"Please reconsider your heavy-handed treatment of remote raid passes. Doubling the price, restricting their daily usage, and lowering their rewards relative to in-person raids is a drastic step against anyone who isn't surrounded by gyms and free time. Or in my case, when my daughter is at her mother's we spend an hour+ a day playing remotely together. It's very sad that the way we play is for some reason not considered valid by the developers.",1,3/31/2023 21:29,76

17974,Games Apps,Pokeman Go ,"Not sure why I still play it. Niantic doesn't care about the people paying their salaries. Bad event after bad event, and they wonder why they can't make money anymore. So their brilliant minds tell them that in order to make money they will just take away all the things that the community loves about the game and Jack up the price of everything. Stupid!!!",1,3/31/2023 21:25,65
17975,Games Apps,Pokeman Go ,"Pokemon go is just getting worse for the prices, the max coins you can get in a day is 50. Anytime I want to buy a box I have to wait to collect all the coins, the good boxes are usually about 2000 so that's 40 days of coins and by that time they're gone. And buying coins is just so expensive for what you get. Now the remote raid passes being limited is and price increasing is awful for players who have disabilities or are in rural areas and need remote passes to do raids.

17977,Games Apps,Pokeman Go ,"For the past 2 years, the game company (Niantic) has taken a confrontational approach with its customers, reducing features and generally making the user experience worse. Sadly, this trend has reached a new low. They have just announced a massive price hike, in less than 6 months the cost of the most popular in-game store item has more than DOUBLED! I cannot recommend anyone to play this game right now, as the company will make the user experience worse and worse",1,3/31/2023 21:22,81
17978,Games Apps,Pokeman Go ,"By increasing the price of remote raid passes it shows Niantic does not care about its players and only want more money. The remote raid pass was an amazing feature that was added to allow players the opportunity to participate in raids during times like covid, winter, or just giving that option for players who cannot travel for whatever reason. Where I live the winter storms have been really bad and now I am unable to play the game unless I risk going out into dangerous weather. Thanks Niantic.",1,3/31/2023 21:19,89

April 5, 2023 the remote raid pass price is planned to jump to 195 coins from 100 coins, that's almost $3 for one remote raid. Niantic is also making 5 remote raids per day the limit. Never expect to reach level 50 on a legendary pokemon and if you don't already have teams built, say goodbye to ever be on par to compete in master league. Say goodbye to a lot of the player base.",1,3/31/2023 21:09,90

18245,Games Apps,Bingo Blitz,The game is fun but I feel that it should give the people 3 more seconds after the last number is called so people have a chance to collect whatever is under the number.

The puzzles are literally impossible to complete in the number of turns offered without boosts that you pay for and you STILL wont complete half of them so you will pay a lot to receive more turns. You will spend a lot of money. I give it an extra star for the graphics and storyline but it is a complete moneypit. Truly....let the buyer beware!

I literally wasted over a month of grinding their in-game currency to finally be able to make 50 wishes. I figured I'd get at least one 5* item... Nope!!! I'm over this game. Waste of time.

Waiting for almost 1.5 years for a character banner, which is the main point of gacha games btw, to collect the characters, is just plain unacceptable at this point.

19133,Games Apps,Genshin Impact,I've played the game and PC and mobile and I think it's really cool every character is balanced and well made and design's are really interesting and whenever there's a new update I will always look forward too it because there is special events that give me primogems and it's used to gacha a character and the wish tab u can do a 10x pull or 1 pull although I don't really like that it's kinda expensive like 160 primogems to do 1x pull and 1600 10x pull that's okay anyways try downloading :D,5,3/31/2023 11:47,94

19142,Games Apps,Genshin Impact,"it is a good game it just doesn't fit the ""Amazing game"" there are TOO many quests and it gets annoying so easily and you will rage quit and the monsters get too hard when you level your world up and it's just too much and the wish system is bad cuz you can lose 50/50 and NOBODY wants to lose the 50/50 (attest you get guaranteed) but I like it it's a good game and the gameplay is also not too bad if you play on the computer, the game takes to much space on phones.also ADD A SKIP BUTTON!",4,3/31/2023 11:09,101

19202,Games Apps,Solitaire Grand Harvest,I love this app! I love solitaire always have. Used to play with a deck. But kids make it hard to becaus they use or tare them up. This way i can continue to play even if I dont have coins I can play light mode free till i have enough to play a bonus game to get more coins. The events are cool and helpful too. Only problem is as the levels get higher and harder they get more expensive. So if i play. It costs all the harvest and i dont have extra for extra cards or anything having to end the game,5,3/31/2023 23:59,105
19206,Games Apps,Solitaire Grand Harvest,"I like it but it comes to a point where you win a level and then loose like 20 times on the next one. Then win but loose another 20. The more $$ you have the faster it sucks it up, therefore, you run out of it fast. If you win a level and it costs like 3000 you most of the time win a minimum of 3400. So basically nothing.

You only get coins every hour and it's only as much as the lowest level. And I've tried so hard to get all of these cat cards but it gets impossible. I had 500k a week ago and now I'm down to 200 coins, because I used them all playing higher levels for the cat cards. The high levels are over 30k coins.",2,3/30/2023 18:53,94

19607,Games Apps,Fishdom,I was enjoying the game and purchased the 4.99 VIP pass and it only lasted one night. They need to make it clear when you purchase how long it will last because a new season began less than 12 hours after my purchase and I did not have access to any of the perks after that. Rip off do not buy the VIP pass,2,3/31/2023 21:40,64

The game isn't bad, but if you are going to advertise the mini games then just let us play them.

Does it really bother your algorithm that much that i save my powerups and diamonds? It's even a Normal level.

19672,Games Apps,Fishdom,"This game is super fun. Basically ad-free. Some stages you can't win and it doesn't matter what you move and where. So it's mostly about luck. The biggest problem is that I have to continuously feed the fish, which takes forever. There's a bug that one or two fish will not eat, unless I exit and enter the specific aquarium and it kinda resets them. The game is fun, but some aspects are really annoying.",3,3/31/2023 10:48,75

19715,Games Apps,Fishdom,"FD is a good game to play until problems and glitches start happening in the game. Support do try at times but more often than not any boosters that are lost are not reimbursed, too many times there are team members who do not receive the same event or tournament as the rest of the team gets. Glitches and problems are too often not solved quickly and sometimes go on for weeks, making this a disheartening game to play. So play at your own risk.",1,3/30/2023 22:43,85

19717,Games Apps,Fishdom,"The game is great until you reach those ""unbeatable"" levels which attempt to bait you into paying to get more gems to get more perks just so you can pass a level.

19724,Games Apps,Fishdom,"COMPLETELY pay to win once you get past 70/80 levels. You get less turns and WAY harder things to do.

19736,Games Apps,Fishdom,"Idk why but the game was updated and they changed the game boosts you used to get. You used to start off with lightning, now you start off with 2 of those rockets that really don't do much. It makes it harder to win so you have to keep buying boosters. I don't mind spending some money but I'm not gonna pay to win every 3 or 4 levels.",4,3/30/2023 18:36,69

20879,Educational,Khan Academy,I was looking for some teaching for my kid & downloaded this app thinking Khan Sir himself will be teaching but was disappointed as these seems to be computer generated voice. I randomly opened one chapter which started to check my BODMAS knowledge. The 3rd question ans should have been 100 (50+50) but as per app it's zero (-50+50) which is wrong.

Please improve the touch responsiveness, the last best version was 5.2.5, after that the app has become buggy. Also please disable the auto rotate to landscape or portrait feature, it's just not perfect and works even when my device's auto rotate is turned off.

20907,Educational,Khan Academy,There is no way one can give feedback/review of videos for improvements. Because there are many topics which are very poorly explained and need a lot of improvements for learners to understand properly. The teachers are not explaining in a proper way which in turn causes students to lose interest. Feedback option on every video is necessary.,1,3/8/2023 17:01,57

The keyboard is painful to use and it's evident that it's just a website. It's also hard to search for lessons. You can't go to an exercise that's part of a lesson to go that lesson. Instead you have to find a video and then go to the lesson you were looking for. Khan Academy is still much easier to use in a browser on a larger screen.",2,3/3/2023 5:52,95

21559,Educational,TED,The TED is one of the best application out there to learn interesting topics. the user interface is clean and convenient easy to use and all the contents are great but the only that disappointed me is that it feels slow to respond very touch you make. sometimes it takes almost a minute to respond the icons that you touch. other than that the application is working impressively good. the developers should do something to eliminate the slow response issue.,4,10/23/2022 7:14,80

Turns out there was supposed to be a practice button but that didn't appear until reinstalling. There isn't much in the free version before you're forced to decide if it's worth paying.

The only thing is (I'm assuming it's because it's not a real language, just a star wars one) there is no sound or pronunciation of the words, but I can just watch the movies and series to listen.

They broke what didn't need fixing; the app isn't what it used to be. It's one thing to introduce features and ask us to pay for them, it's entirely lame to take features away that used to be free.

22898,Educational,Memrise,"Good but definitely room to improve. It would be nice if streaks were not limited to one course. I spend many weeks in the app and then the streak resetting for ever course is stupid. Also, when you hear the sound of the word and then the word in the new language, it would he helpful to have the translation also appear after you click on the word. At the moment you can hear a word in a new language, click on it, but then it doesn't help memorize it if you don't remember the translation 🫠🤷",4,3/20/2023 9:23,97

22902,Educational,Memrise,"Going into this it seemed really good. There are real speakers of the language, and most words are correct. However, there are some things I don't like about it. 1. There should be a report button if something is incorrect. There was a video playing that didn't say the correct word. (Wrong video) 2. I wish it would walk you through pronunciation instead of just giving you the word. It would also help to check the pronunciation like Duolingo does.",3,3/19/2023 18:25,80

22936,Educational,Memrise,This is sooo bad. In most later exercises it either doesn't show you the translation at all or it is jumping to the next question so fast you don't have time to read it. I would say it's pretty much pointless to use at this point.,1,3/15/2023 21:26,46

Also reckon I learn useful vocabulary faster with this app than with Duolingo (am using both). Sadly, Unit 2 is not proving as smooth. No more skits 😭 and it regularly seems to bug and forget which words I've already learned... Unit 1 deserved 5 stars.

A couple were about the same somehow, but the rest were just not correct at all. This is very weird and very unreasonable. There's literally no reason to charge anyone for this.",2,3/26/2023 8:30,88

24665,Health and Fitness,Strong,"I have been using the app since the beginning of the year, and I like it a lot. I even think if unlocking the paid features. Though there are two things I don't like: 1) For single arm/leg exercises there isn't a way to enter weight and set per limb, so you have to enter the combined weight of, for example, bicep curls, if you want the total weight to show in the end, instead of entering the weight of the dumbbells used, and have the app multiply it by 2. 2) Bigger library of exercises.",4,2/10/2023 19:48,96

24731,Health and Fitness,Strong,"Love it. One recommendation, if you can have it so that you can merge 2 separate workouts into 1 that would be awesome so that you dont have to spend the time rebuilding 2 workouts into 1. Also if you have the same routine for lets say 1 month then you would scroll left to see the progress instead of having to scroll down and look for that same workout the week or two before.

I only want unlimited templates and I wouldn't consider paying 100€ just for them. • The app is great and I would gladly pay a reasonable price but the template limitation is ridiculous and ruins the whole app if you need more templates.

25008,Health and Fitness,CalorieCounter-MyNetDiary,Walked away from My fitness pal due to their ridiculous charging and useless free version. This is better than the other by miles and the free version of this is absolutely brilliant so good in fact that the modest price of the full version is worth it. Still testing but seriously impressed but I can see paid coming just to say thanks. The competitor previously mentioned have locked it up so much its not worth spending the data to download and the prices are disgusting. This app however is 5*,5,3/30/2023 15:09,90

25024,Health and Fitness,CalorieCounter-MyNetDiary,As a calorie counter alone I give this app three stars but it won't allow you to do much else without purchasing their premium service. You can't even adjust your macros. I gave it 3 stars because you can scan barcodes.,3,3/27/2023 13:21,41

Putting a recipe in just when you're entering that specific meal is inconvenient. Also, being able to copy-paste a whole recipe and then tweak the amounts would be great. That's about the only thing left on MFP that is better than on this site. Being able to look at a list of recipes I've entered helps me meal plan a month out.",4,3/3/2023 18:56,89

A thing you could improve to make your app even better and connect with more of your audience is to add a edit feature after you have clicked finish, Not having this can cause frustration if a person mis-logs a set or wants to change something after that workout is completed.

Suggestions for some (minor) improvements: 1) Option to select an icon for a custom training. 2) Option to select an icon for a custom exercise. 3) Option to select custom colors for the exercise logo's based on muscle group. 4) Option to overwrite value directly (not editing existing value) when changing reps of weights. 5) Option to modify reps or weights in customizable steps per exercise with plus and minus logo's instead of typing.,5,3/8/2023 17:48,83

The app has confirmed that it is a lot, even on a slow day, so sure, it did what I expected. The problem is with the notifications from the app chastising me for failing to meet my 'goal' during the time that I literally didn't have the app. Even if I had had the app and took zero steps, it is appallingly gross to program something theoretically intended as a fitness aid to shame the users.",1,1/26/2023 21:59,98

A minor heads up and suggestion though: The pushup exercice seems to be missing? I could just manually add it but I found it weird since pull-ups were present within the list. It would be nice to be able to add our own categories like mobility for people who want to improve their flexibility via stretches (bridge and twist hold progressions).

26068,Health and Fitness,RepCount,"I took 5 minutes to think about what to write here, since the app is really good. For me it does everything you need without any bloatwear, it works as good as pen and paper, which might not seem hard to find, but trust me, it is. Plus you have a neat timer. If you pay for premium you will also get a beat graphs to track your progress which is not necessary and I bought it more to support the app, also the superset function you get with it is neat! I recommend this app wholeheartedly!",5,9/11/2022 15:06,97

26074,Health and Fitness,RepCount,"Excellent app, especially for a newbie like me. If I could make a suggestion? If links could be enabled in the notes section. Sometimes you come across a workout that's different you want to try, or an alternative to one you're doing. It's great trying to describe a workout, but it's better if there's a link to remind you of form and technique on a web page or video. Other than that no problems hear!

26080,Health and Fitness,RepCount,"I've used this app a lot and it's great. Only way this app could be better is if it would allow users to add more body parts such as neck, or be more specific per body part like upper/lower back, quads/hamstrings etc. Otherwise very easy to use and probably the best app to use for tracking your progress. Would be great if you could make routines based on time as well instead of just reps and sets. For example do jumping jacks for 30 seconds rest for 10 and so on with more exercices.",5,8/12/2022 1:40,94

26089,Health and Fitness,RepCount,it's easy to mess up and edit a previous workout by accident. also the way you track present weights compared to past is kind of cumbersome.,3,7/10/2022 16:29,26

26106,Health and Fitness,RepCount,I've been using rep count for three years now and I have only ever been overwhelmingly satisfied.

26116,Health and Fitness,RepCount,"I love this app so much. For all of the people complaining about the lack of pre-loaded exercises: it's meant to be FLEXIBLE. You get to add and edit exercises, which I love—it really let's me make my own routines. I love that I can leave notes for myself on specific days or exercises, because I'll sometimes have forgotten why I made a change by the next time I get to that exercise and I can use this as a reminder. I'll be getting the premium sometime this year for sure and I can't wait!",5,4/20/2022 10:48,95
26117,Health and Fitness,RepCount,"This app is amazing! I just started using the basic one yesterday, but it has already helped me see directly what I need to do at the gym and the goals obtained for the day.

26126,Health and Fitness,RepCount,"I've been using the premium version of this app for years and it's fairly simple to use and has done job for my clients and I.

26139,Health and Fitness,RepCount,"Great app, one critical flaw. On Android, the timer doesn't give an audible cue (or shut of the music) unless your phone is unlocked and the app is in focus. I lock my phone between sets so I can put it into my pocket during rests without accidentally touching stuff on it.

Now I'm exploring and see there are many more options. It's built so intuitively it's motivating. I tried OpenFit, Daily Burn, DanceFitMe, etc and this is the only one I kept.

Parking's gtreat My 3 favorite instructors are Ann, Meredith & Anna. The overhead white florescent lights are too bright. The music iloud & hip hoppy; the music scenario would definitely improve w/ house and/or electronic dance music. Sometimes it's hard to hear the instructor w/ the music.

27201,Health and Fitness,Fio,I signed up for this app but was disappointed. I liked Joanna's fitness videos on YouTube but could hardly find any of them on this app. What disappointed me most was that you do not even have to do the fitness video to complete a day all you have to do is log in and look through the days routine and they say you completed the day. Also I canceled my account and was somehow charged for a year subscription. If that was the fault of the app or google I am not sure but I am not happy about it.,1,1/24/2023 13:50,101

It was legitimately the most useful app on my phone, but not anymore. They destroyed this app, it is so unbelievably expensive and pretentious. I would give it 0 stars if I could.

27306,Health and Fitness,BetterSleep,The content is great. The app is a constant source of irritation. Would be better if it performed consistently and they stopped messing with it. It seems they couldn't quite decide on the direction for this and tried to do eveything.

27420,Health and Fitness,BetterSleep,"I began using Better Sleep for the introductory period. When that ended I was billed, but decided to cancel. I was surprised that customer service immediately reached out and offered a nice discount for the annual subscription if I wanted to continue. I agreed but within a few days realized I would not utilize the features in the app. Again I requested a refund. Within hours I was credited. The app is easy to use, graphics are beautiful. The customer service is 5-star outstanding.",5,3/6/2023 19:02,84
27421,Health and Fitness,BetterSleep,"It's annoying to use. Almost everything is behind a pay wall. I tried the free trial since it said I had 14 days to try it out. That was a lie, I had 7. I'm stuck with a year-long subscription, so I'm making it work. You can't look back at past weeks or months of tracking. If you're recording sound, it will pick up every wake-up alarm you set or any video you watch. The app takes super long to load your journal, like stupid long. There are so many things I don't like. But it's kinda ok",2,3/6/2023 12:58,98

27426,Health and Fitness,BetterSleep,"So, to cancel before the free trial is impossible as it's not activated in your account until they take their first payment from you.

27476,Health and Fitness,BetterSleep,"I've used this app for a couple of months. Overall, it's a nice app, but it doesn't keep a record of your nights sleep beyond a week. Also, if you miss a night, the next nights results aren't shown due to the app comparing the previous night to determine that nights success, or so it seems. Hopefully, the programmers are working on that. But I can't afford the monthly fee for a sleep tracking app that doesn't keep my data more for more than 7 days.

Not really happy about this app as there is really no free part to it. Insight Timer is 100 times better than Headspace. Headspace is The Worst App Ever.

Now there are so many different meditation options to choose from that you have analysis paralysis before even beginning. It became complicated for someone who's just starting.

27842,Health and Fitness,Sync go,"The overview says it features trimming songs for desired length. I can't seem to find this feature, or the Sync 30 update. Anyone have advice on this?",4,5/29/2019 16:10,27
27843,Health and Fitness,Sync go,"My app hasn't the option to create playlists so, when I download the songs to the computer, I can't download them any more and I can't play them without searching them one by one on my phone. The problem gets bigger when I must give a STRONG30 class, where I must cut the songs by myself.",3,5/12/2019 20:13,56
27844,Health and Fitness,Sync go,I'm so frustrated. 3 hours between clients so I'm trying to learn my choreo but without access to the video I have no idea what it's supposed to look like! I have access to 1Gb month of data and even then my gym is in a blackspot! This wouldn't be a problem if you'd let us download the videos. I have to sacrifice my personal time to learn at home.,2,3/24/2019 22:30,70
27846,Health and Fitness,Sync go,Best thing Zumba ever did was get these apps for streaming! 👏👏👏😍,5,3/4/2019 19:38,12
27847,Health and Fitness,Sync go,I think the app would be great if it would stop having an error while loading my music! It will tell me I have an internet connection problem and will not play the next song in my playlist. fix that in this would be five stars,3,3/2/2019 2:43,46
27848,Health and Fitness,Sync go,"I love this app! Super easy to use, create a playlist or just replace the last quadrant. I only miss the option to create STRONG 30 class. I always need to search the songs when I am teaching and it breaks the class. As soon as this option is available I will be giving 5*!!!",4,2/1/2019 0:19,55
27849,Health and Fitness,Sync go,"Issues with the SyncGo app loading songs in a playlist... takes too long to load next song or just doesn't load it at all... just says ""error loading song"".. otherwise I think the app is great very user-friendly, nice to be able to view the videos in the app as well, easy to build playlists",4,1/21/2019 21:11,55
27850,Health and Fitness,Sync go,So I'm not too sure cause I have unlimited 4g and tried connecting it to wifi but sometimes my songs dont load. Like I will be teaching a class and itll say problem with internet connection. Luckily I have all my songs backed up on spotify.,2,1/3/2019 19:32,46

27859,Health and Fitness,Sync go,Like being able to see the videos for your playlist! Makes a quick review much easier. Would like to be able to add a few seconds break for students to get their mats for Q4 & to get up off the floor for cool down.,4,11/13/2018 20:50,45

27863,Health and Fitness,Sync go,I've been waiting for this app! So helpful for instructors with set features designed for quadrants to customize each. Only issue I had was adding in the warm up through the playlist building feature. I used the workaround of searching for the song and then adding it to the playlist.,4,11/13/2018 20:04,50
