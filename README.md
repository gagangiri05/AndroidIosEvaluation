# Android and Ios App Evaluation

This project's objective is to assess available apps for iOS and Android based on user reviews. The reviews are first preprocessed and scrapped. We intend to employ NLP, sentiment analysis, and entity analysis and review mining to determine which aspects of the app users like and dislike.
